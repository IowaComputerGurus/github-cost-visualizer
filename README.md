### Action Minute Reporting

The Github Cost Visualizer provides action/minute consumption data in a number of formats.

* A summary count of total minutes used
* A tabular view of minute usage by repository
* A pie-chart view of minute usage by repository
* A tabular view by Operating System
* A pie-chart view of minute usage by repository

Using these reporting options you can pinpoint your key usage areas, and even do basic forecasting based on information contained within.

### Average Daily Storage Reporting

Storage usage reporting on GitHub is somewhat complicated, so to try and provide the "best" information possible we have focused on showing "daily average" information over the period of reporting.  Future releases will continue to refine this process.  You can view this information in the following views.

* An overall summary of average daily storage
* A list of storage used by repository
* A pie chart of usage by repository
